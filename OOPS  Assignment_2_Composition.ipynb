    "Here are some of the benefits of using composition over inheritance in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flexibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition is more flexible than inheritance, as it allows for more dynamic behavior. For example, you can use composition to create a class that can have different types of objects as members, depending on the situation. This can be useful for modeling complex relationships between objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loose coupling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition can lead to loose coupling between classes, which can make the code easier to maintain and modify. For example, if you use composition to create a class that has a member of another class, you can change the implementation of the other class without affecting the first class. This is because the first class only has a reference to the other class, not a copy of its code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code reuse:\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition can also lead to code reuse, as it allows you to use existing classes in new ways. For example, you can use composition to create a class that combines the functionality of two or more existing classes. This can save you time and effort, as you don't have to write new code from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition can make code easier to test, as it allows you to isolate the functionality of each class. For example, you can test a class that uses composition by creating mock objects for its members. This can help you to identify and fix bugs more quickly."
